# What

A simple example on how to use the systick timer to generate periodic events using  [DAVE4](https://infineoncommunity.com/dave-download_ID645) (NO DAVE APPS) for [xmc2go](https://www.ehitex.de/en/application-kits/infineon/2512/xmc-2go) by Infineon.
The rest of the files was generated using DAVE4 (simple main template).

# Use 
Import with project wizard, compile, connect xmc2go and debug. You should see the red LED on the board blinking.

# Purpose
Minimal working example to test toolchain setup.
